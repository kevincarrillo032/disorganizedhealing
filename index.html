  <h2>Attachment Styles</h2>

  <p>
    In case you’ve been under a rock over the last 5–10 years,
    <strong><em>attachment styles</em></strong> have been key in helping individuals understand how they form and affect their relationships.
  </p>

  <p>These different attachment styles are as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Secure</li>
    <li>Ambivalent</li>
    <li>Avoidant</li>
    <li><em>Disorganized</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But since you’ve come to this corner of the web, you probably only care about disorganized attachment styles, am I right?
  </p>

  <h3>Disorganized Attachment</h3>

  <p>
    The disorganized attachment style, also known as <em>fearful-avoidant</em>, combines elements of both anxious and avoidant attachment, leading to unpredictable behavior in relationships. This unpredictable behavior can stem from difficulty trusting others due to childhood trauma, neglect, or abuse. This leads to the child seeing their caregivers as a source of comfort <em>and</em> fear. This inconsistency can lead to disorganized behaviors.
  </p>

  <h3>Signs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Fear of rejection</li>
    <li>Inability to regulate emotions</li>
    <li>Contradictory behaviors</li>
    <li>High levels of anxiety</li>
    <li>Difficulty trusting others</li>
    <li>Signs of both avoidant and anxious attachment styles</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How It Manifests In Relationships</h3>

  <p>
    People with disorganized attachment styles tend to have unpredictable and confusing behavior in relationships. Some have said they alternate between being aloof and independent and clingy and emotional.
  </p>

  <p>
    While they desperately seek love, they also push partners away because of the fear of love. They believe that they’ll always be rejected, but they don’t avoid emotional intimacy. They fear it, and they also consistently seek it out, only to reject it again.
  </p>

  <p>
    They perceive their partners as unpredictable, and they themselves behave in unpredictable ways within their relationships as they continue to wrestle between the need for security and fear.
  </p>

  <h2>How Disorganized Attachment Affects Physical Health</h2>

  <p>
    So we know that, whatever attachment style you have, you're gonna feel pretty messed up sometimes, like your brain is hijacked. But how does a <strong>disorganized attachment</strong> affect us physically?
  </p>

  <h3>1. Chronic Stress and Dysregulated Nervous System</h3>

  <p>People with disorganized attachment often live in a <strong>constant state of hypervigilance</strong>, which keeps their bodies in “fight, flight, or freeze” mode.</p>

  <p>The <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong> is frequently activated, which can lead to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Elevated heart rate</li>
    <li>High blood pressure</li>
    <li>Poor digestion</li>
    <li>Chronic muscle tension</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Immune System Suppression</h3>

  <p>Constant stress hormones like <strong>cortisol</strong> can suppress the immune system over time.</p>

  <p>This makes individuals more susceptible to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Frequent colds</li>
    <li>Autoimmune conditions</li>
    <li>Slow wound healing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Gut-Brain Axis Imbalance</h3>

  <p>Chronic stress and emotional trauma can disrupt the <strong>gut microbiome</strong>, contributing to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)</li>
    <li>Inflammation</li>
    <li>Food sensitivities</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Sleep Disruptions</h3>

  <p>Difficulty feeling safe or regulated can result in <strong>insomnia or poor sleep quality</strong>, which negatively affects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cognitive function</li>
    <li>Hormonal imbalance</li>
    <li>Energy levels</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Somatic Symptoms</h3>

  <p>Unresolved trauma often shows up as <strong>unexplained physical pain</strong> or <strong>fatigue</strong>.</p>

  <p>These might include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Stomachaches</li>
    <li>Muscle pain</li>
    <li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>So What Can We Do?</h2>

  <p>At the root of all this is the actual attachment style itself. The manifestations are simply byproducts of the stress these individuals are experiencing <strong>from their attachment style.</strong></p>

  <p>There is a growing body of research and therapeutic approaches specifically targeting the healing of disorganized attachment styles. While much of the early work focused on infants and children, recent studies have expanded to explore effective treatments for adults as well.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT05927324">Clinician-Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Approach Therapy (CAVEAT)</a></h3>

  <p>Developed by Dr. Daniel Schechter and colleagues, CAVEAT is a 16-session psychotherapy designed for traumatized parents and their young children. It utilizes video feedback to help parents reflect on their interactions with their children, aiming to improve mentalization and emotional regulation. This approach has shown promise in altering parents’ perceptions and enhancing their relationships with their children.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://counselingcentergroup.com/disorganized-attachment/">Attachment-Based Therapy</a></h3>

  <p>Attachment-based therapy focuses on understanding and modifying attachment patterns. It has been effective in addressing insecure attachment styles, including disorganized attachment, by fostering secure connections and improving emotional resilience.</p>

  <p>This method emphasizes the importance of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Practicing open communication</li>
    <li>Establishing and maintaining boundaries</li>
    <li>Self-regulation and grounding techniques</li>
    <li>Challenging your inner critic</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

  <p>Healing from disorganized attachment isn’t about “fixing” yourself. It’s about reconnecting with safety, trust, and regulation. The body holds the shit, but it also holds the power to heal. Whether through therapy, “the work”, or simply becoming more aware, you’ve already started by seeking this out.</p>

  <p>If you want to learn more about regulating your nervous system or navigating relationships with this attachment style, I’ve got more resources coming. Stay tuned.</p>
